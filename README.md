This is challenge #2 from [coding challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc/) by John Crickett. This is a simple wc tool with fewer functionalities than the wc tool available in Unix based systems.

By the end of building this program, I learnt a lot about the quirks of C and difficulty in building in a low-level environment, it has made me appreciate high-level languages a lot more. Despite all this, I still find joy building in low-level environment and I will continue writing in C.

Special thanks to [shellmonk](https://github.com/shellmonk) for this wc program. I had to copy some of his code to finish this project and I learnt a lot from reading code too.
