This is challenge #1 from Coding Challenges by John Crickett.
I will be using it to learn C.

---

By the end of building this program, I learnt a lot about the quirks of C and difficulty in building in a low-level environment, it has made me appreciate high-level languages a lot more. Despite all this, I still find joy building in low-level environment and I will continue writing in C.

Special thanks to [shellmonk](https://github.com/shellmonk) for this wc program. I had to copy some of his code to finish this project and I learnt a lot from reading code too.
